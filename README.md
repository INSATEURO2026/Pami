# SIMA Eurobot 2026 Project üêøÔ∏èü§ñ  

## üìñ Overview  
This repository contains the development of our robot and **SIMA (Small Independent Mobile Actuators)** for the **Eurobot 2026 international robotics competition**.  

The 2026 theme is:  
> *‚ÄúWinter is coming! Squirrels must collect, store, and protect their hazelnuts from evil humans before they return.‚Äù*  

Our robot system is fully autonomous (Eurobot Open rules) and works alongside SIMA to complete various game actions such as:  
- Collecting and storing hazelnut crates.  
- Emptying the granary and replacing crates with rotten nuts.  
- Adjusting temperature using thermometers.  
- Returning safely to the nest at match end.  
- Deploying SIMAs to pantries for the ‚ÄúLunch Time‚Äù mission.

## üéØ Objectives  
- Design and build a **main autonomous robot**.  
- Develop **SIMA units** for secondary tasks.  
- Implement robust strategies to score points in all five actions:  
  1. **Let‚Äôs Keep the Hazelnuts Warm!**  
  2. **To Find Is to Keep!**  
  3. **Not Too Warm, Not Too Cold**  
  4. **Nest, Sweet Nest**  
  5. **Lunch Time!**
